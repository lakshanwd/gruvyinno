					<h3>Why “GRUVYINNO”?</h3>
					<p>In the present day context where funding for Development work awarded to middle income countries is hugely
						decreasing, obtaining funds for such work by organizations engaged in Development work has become highly
						competitive.</p>
					<p>Any Organization engaged in Projects as well as pursuing new ventures, In the present context where competition
						comes from literally the ‘rest of the world’ , Corporate sector can also succeed only if it adopts innovation,
						creativity and project management best practices to ensure a distinctive competitive advantage.</p>
					<br />
					<h3>How can Organizations Overcome this Challenge?</h3>
					<p>By producing Funding Proposals which are innovative, highly analytical & strategically placed, visibly results
						driven, widely consultative and as far as possible collaborative interventions with other directly and indirectly
						relevant stakeholders.</p>
					<p>The scarcity of funds in the Development sector and the high competition in the Corporate sector, makes
						funders/donors very particular on assurance that Projects/Programs reach the expected objectives and goals. To
						enable this, the Projects/Programs should be systematically & strategically planned based on accurate situation
						analysis & baselines taking full account of all opportunities,risks and challenges, implemented on time & within
						the budgets, progress monitored systematically aligning to comprehensive monitoring & evaluation frameworks and
						comprehensive and analytical reports produced.</p>
					<p>Project Management best practices and proper processes will help organizations to complete the work
						systematically and professionally, as everything will be done in a properly planned sequence starting from
						setting the goals and objectives of the Project to implementing the strategies for achieving these goals/
						objectives/ outputs.</p>
					<br />
					<h3>What Could be the Approach to Achieve?</h3>
					<p>Adopting a very professional and effective Project Management Cycle in the Projects/Programs organizations
						undertake and record qualitative high performance.</p>
					<p style="font-weight: bold;">However, for most organizations recruiting as staff and retaining persons of high
						caliber, with specific specialized professional knowledge, skills and practical experience to handle efficiently
						all the different stages of Project Cycle is extremely costly and not manageable. Training existing or recruited
						staff to achieve this level of performance could also be highly cost and time consuming.</p>
					<p style="font-weight: bold;">With this scenario, the most cost effective and results yielding solution could be
						to obtain specific specialized professional services needed to optimize effective management and delivery of
						Projects, not available within the organization, through Consultants with professional knowledge, skills and
						extensive practical experience in the relevant areas of Project/Program cycle.</p>
					<p>This would enable organizations to achieve professional excellence in management of Projects/Programs and reach
						objectives/goals in line with budgetary and time restrictions.</p>
